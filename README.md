# weather-or-not
Sample Project with Node.js to check the weather near you.

This project utilizes sort of MEAN stack. There is no db so no mongo, but the server is written in Node using the Express framework
, and data is bound to the dom using Angular.

The app is deployed to heroku at https://talk-about-the-weather.herokuapp.com/.
